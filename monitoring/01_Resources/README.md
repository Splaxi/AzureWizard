# Create resources to monitor for the workshop Azure Management

## Deploy the resoruces we want to monitor to Azure

This template creates a few Azure Resources we want to later monitor.

*Note:* This template specifies a defaultValue for a secureString on purpose in order for it to be deployable hands free. This is normally NOT adviced at all! The intent is for this template to be deployable using the Azure EducationHub (preview)!
